COMP5347 Assignment2

Project Description

This project is a javascript based assignment that utilize React framework as the frontend and Express as the backend. The non-sql database named MongoDB is selected as the database hosted by AWS. Rather than using compass, we have decided to use Altas which is the cloud verision of MongDB and it's better for collaboration. We have also chosen SendGrid as my thirdparty email automation partner. Since we did not have the time to optmize the email automation, verification email and notification email might go into your spam/junk mail.
